# JARVIS (But not really)

##UPDATE 8/8/2015
This was my first GitHub project. Back in 2011, I didn't realize how ambitious writing a personal assistant in C was. Eventually I got a semi-working shell back then (still quite an impressive achievement considering my knowledge at the time). Now I've worked out the bugs in the shell and parsing code.

Right now this project can:
* print a prompt
* accept input on a single line
* seperate that line into arguments
* print the arguments on seperate lines

Maybe I'll find some use for this eventually. For now this was just an excercise in troubleshooting brought about by late-night boredom.

##Original readme from 2011.
This was a first attempt at building a personal assistant. C does not seem to be the right langauge to use. There is a new Java version in progress here. https://github.com/enterthefuture/JARVIS-2.0
